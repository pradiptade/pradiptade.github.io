          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>Current projects in the lab are along two themes.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>(Mobile) Application design using Machine Learning:</b> We
              explore use of data driven techniques for designing novel
              applications, such as recognizing emotions from smartphone
              activities, or student attention levels in classroom based on
              screen activity. We also work on analysis of traffic from mobile
              devices, especially video traffic. </li>
            <li><b>Design and Application of Mobile Edge Computing: </b> Mobile
              Edge Computing (MEC) is a paradigm where remote resources can be
              harnessed to seamlessly augment the capabilities of a mobile
              device. The remote resource can be within the local area network,
              or reside in the cloud within large data centers. Use of MEC can
              help in designing novel applications by allowing enhanced
              resources, but it may come at a cost of higher latency. Our
              objective is to explore the space of novel applications, without
              degrading the user experience due to the use of networked
              resources. </li>

              <div> <button href="#project5" class="myButton">Show Details</button>

              <div id="project5" style="display:none">
                <p> Ability to detect the emotion states of an individual to
                  different contextual and environmental stimuli has numerous
                  applications. Affective computing relates to capturing
                  emotions of an individual based on cues, like activity
                  patterns, interaction patterns, physiological data from
                  wearable devices. With growing use of mobile devices, data
                  sources that help to recognize mental states, or emotions, of
                  individuals are increasing. Wearable devices and smartphones,
                  which are becoming ubiquitous in our lives, will be valuable
                  source of data for diagnosis and even treatment of mental
                  health disorders, like depression, bipolar disease, and
                  rehabilitation from addictions. We investigate novel
                  techniques for emotion recognition, specially focusing on the
                  use of mobile and wearable devices for data collection, and
                  improving the accuracy of detection by intelligently combining
                  different data sources. </p>

              <div> <button href="#project1" class="myButton">Show Details</button>
              </div>
              <div id="project1" style="display:none">
                <p>Several approaches in locationing systems, both indoor and
                  outdoor, explore the use of fingerprints hidden in the user's
                  environment to identify a location. Images, and image
                  features, constitute one of the natural fingerprints of a
                  location. Cues inside an image, like landmarks, are matched
                  against a database of geotagged images for locationing, but
                  the process is compute and time intensive.In this work, we
                  present the use of texts in the images, to pinpoint a user's
                  location. The key intuition behind this work is that the
                  collection of names of businesses, appearing in an image forms
                  a bag-of-words that provides a unique signature for a
                  location. Typically, use of OCR in outdoor settings is
                  considered a hard problem, specially on resource constrained
                  smartphones. We design a system, called WhereAmI, which
                  presents a practical solution to the OCR problem. A fast
                  bag-of-words matching technique, that can handle errors in
                  text detection, is designed for locationing. We have
                  implemented WhereAmI on Android based smartphones and
                  evaluated the locationing accuracy under different settings in
                  multilingual environment. </p>

                <p>The mobile edge/cloud paradigm promises to augment resource
                  limited mobile devices by providing unlimited compute power.
                  Offloading part of the computation of an application not only
                  saves battery power, but also speeds up the computation.
                  However, selecting the appropriate portions for offloading is
                  challenging, specially under different constraints, like
                  variable and unreliable wireless channel, tight real-time
                  deadlines to complete tasks. In this project, we are exploring
                  the design space of mobile cloud computing systems, with a
                  focus on real-time applications, like video streaming. </p>

Each of these applications demand the network                  resource, and wake up the network card on the smartphone in an                  unsynchronized manner for communication. The network card                  consumes energy. Any time when the card is woken up, and goes                  underutilized, there is a wastage of energy. Our goal in this                  project is to devise efficient traffic shaping mechanisms that                  can balance energy usage while maintaining high Quality of                  Experience for users. </p>              </div>            </li>           -->
